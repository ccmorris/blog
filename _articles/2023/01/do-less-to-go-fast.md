Time is the limiting factor for the amount of work that can be accomplished. To be effective it is imperative to be efficient with your time. But how? Do less.

Identify the decisions that are inconsequential and easy to change; I call these immaterial choices. These decisions are black holes! When it comes to coding (and many other tasks), 90% of decisions are immaterial choices. Pick something and move on to more impactful work.

Challenge decisions that are not necessary to be made now. The quickest decision is one that is deferred until later. Between now and "later" there may be more lessons learned about the domain. Note this does not mean defer _all_ decisions! If it is going to block work or if it is _more_ challenging to implement later, then now is the time.

Copy solutions to solved problems. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Much of the time when coding a product feature it is similar, at least in structure, to other features. Copy it! Don't get me wrong, there is a time and place for challenging the status quo. When the goal is to move fast, it is not the time.

These three methods are ways that have allowed me to trim the fat and focus on impactful work.
